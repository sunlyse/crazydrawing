# CrazyDrawing

[crazydrawing.space](http://crazydrawing.space/)

A fun exercise for getting out of creative blocks. Helps to get into the process of making new and unusual ideas.
Available in two languages [Russian](http://crazydrawing.space/ru) and [English](http://crazydrawing.space/en).

### Who is it for

We have created this exercise for ourselves and those who want to find ways to overcome creative blocks or get into the mood of generating new ideas easily. We hope it can be useful for anyone who seeks to find a fun way to **connect to their inner child** and open their mind.

The exercise is free and available for everyone here [crazydrawing.space](http://crazydrawing.space/). 

### How it works

Every 2 minutes the exercise shows a random phrase on the screen. Your task is to draw it within 2 minutes and quickly move on to the next one.
There is 15 exercises per set, but you can repeat the sets as many times as you need.

### When this exercise is useful

 - When you are about to start working on something that requires a fair amount of creative thinking. The exercise will help to open your mind and start looking at things from the different prospective.
 - Whenever you feel you need to get some "refreshment" for your brain. 
 - When you are tired and want to have a bit of fun.
 - Or every day to increase your overall level of creative thinking.
